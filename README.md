Coursework 2 Specifications

Your second coursework for COM61332 will be based on a group project focussed on Social Media Analytics (SMA) enabled by Text Mining.

Intended Learning Outcomes

<ul>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;to develop and employ a social media analytics (SMA) text mining pipeline on a student-chosen problem</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;to analyse the results obtained by employing the SMA pipeline on the chosen problem</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;to explain how the SMA pipeline was applied to answer questions central to the problem,
and summarise results
</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;to act as a responsible member of a team, communicate with team mates, and contribute to
the team‚Äôs self-organisation, planning and conflict resolution for the duration of the group work

Instructions

Given the chosen topic for your group, you will answer the research questions that you set out for that topic by developing a Social Media Analytics (SMA) pipeline.

Before starting to write any program code, however, your first step should be to identify, together with your group mates, the text mining tasks that will help you answer your research questions. For example:

1) What is the dominant sentiment towards Covid19 vaccines? ‚Äã[Sentiment analysis]

2) Which Covid-19 vaccine brands/manufacturers have been most talked about recently? Do

people prefer any brands? [‚Äã Named entity recognition + Sentiment analysis]

3) Have people been discussing side-effects of the Covid-19 vaccine? If yes, what are these?

[Named entity recognition + named entity linking]

A Jupyter notebook with boilerplate code will be made available to the class. This includes code for
</li>
</ul>
the following tasks, that you can build upon:

A. Datapre-processing

B. Topicmodelling

C. Sentimentanalysis

D. Namedentityrecognition E. Namedentitylinking

As part of your group project, you are expected to adapt (i.e., develop your own enhancements to) any of the code provided to you, in order to ensure that you can address your research questions adequately. For example, your data set might need additional, custom steps for cleaning, or you might want to use different named entity recognition models.

You also have the choice to implement any of the above NLP tasks from scratch. For example, if you found a data set relevant to your topic that is already labelled with sentiments, then you are free to train your own sentiment analysis classification model, as long as you can integrate it into the notebook.

Your final SMA pipeline should be in the form of a Jupyter notebook‚Äîsimilar to what you are provided with‚Äîwhich will allow you to document every step in your pipeline, as well as to more easily visualise results. While the notebook provided to you does not include any code for

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
visualisation, you are encouraged to add this, as you might find the generated diagrams useful in preparing your report (see Deliverables section below).

Note that during the Week 5 Laboratory Session, you will be working on data set retrieval and cleaning (specifications to be given as a Lab Exercise, separately). This should allow you to focus on the NLP tasks from Week 6 until the deadline.

Deliverables

There are two deliverables for this coursework:

<ol>
<li>Social media analytics pipeline. This should come in the form of a Jupyter notebook containing well-documented code for each step in the pipeline, as well as a folder containing any resources required by the code (e.g., data sets that will allow the markers to reproduce your results).</li>
<li>Short paper reporting results. This should be in the form of a research paper (rather than a technical report/user manual), something that can potentially be published (e.g., on ResearchGate, if not in a workshop). A sample paper1 published in The Fifth International Conference on Social Networks Analysis, Management and Security (SNAMS-2018) can be used as a guide. Avoid plagiarism and discuss ideas in your own words.
Template: IEEE Conference format2

Recommended length: 2-3 pages (in two-column format), excluding references.

Marking scheme

This coursework accounts for 25% of your final mark for COMP61332, and is worth 100 points. The following rubric will be used in marking your group project, where the first column specifies the various criteria and the second column indicates the maximum number marks your group can be possibly given. The raw score (out of 40) will be multiplied by a weight (2.5) to obtain a final mark out of 100.

Your deliverables will be assessed based on the marking scheme above, which will lead to one overall mark (out of 100). Everyone in your group will get the same mark: one of the Learning Outcomes of this coursework is focussed on acting as a responsible team member (see Intended Learning Outcomes), hence it is everyone‚Äôs duty to ensure that tasks are delegated fairly, that there are equal contributions, and that integration goes smoothly.

In the exceptional case where one or more group members have not put in an acceptable contribution, despite the team‚Äôs effort to bring them back into the team and suitable discussions of the issues arising, we implement a grievance procedure. A group can bring forward a ‚Äúcase of grievance‚Äù to the COMP61332 teaching staff by providing the following pieces of evidence:

<ul>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;minutes of team meetings</li>
<li>‚óè &nbsp;a written description of the events that led to the break-down of the team work, including a
description of the actions that were taken to get the team back on track

The case should be brought forward to the teaching staff no later than one working week after the coursework deadline. The COMP61332 teaching staff will then decide whether the situation is indeed exceptional and warrants a mark re-distribution.
